RECURRENCE RELATION->
TO WRITE 1D recurrence relation do the following steps->
1.express the problem in terms of index.
2.do all possible stuffs on the index according to the question.
3.return the thing that the problem is asking for.

SPACE OPTIMISATION->
IF THERE IS SOMETHING LIKE index-1 OR index-2 THEN THERE CAN BE ALWAYS SPACE OPTIMISATION.

TABULATION->
1.declare the dp array of same size as declared in memoisation.
2.base case becomes initialisation.
3.whatever you write for recursion , write the opposite for tabulation.
4.In memoisation and tabulation, we declare the space same as that of changing parameters.
